This file holds the Python code for Phase 3

Phase 3 combines the Heat Transfer and differential evolution projects to determine the boundary conditions required to give four point in the heat transfer solution space a specific temperature. 

The no cython versions of the code are Phase_Three.py and Phase_Three_No_Plot.py and

Phase_Three_Cython_Import is the code that brings in the .pyd modules created using cython

Any of the Heat_Transfer scripts/modules can be used with any of the Phase_Three scripts but the .pyd modules need to be changed to use a different Heat_Transfer using the setup.py script
