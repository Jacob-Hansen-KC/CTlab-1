This folder contains the codes from projects 1-3 that are cythonized to create a c version of the script then put into modules to be run by other scripts.

The .pyx scripts are turned into c files using setup.py then turned into python functions using the terminal command below.

python -/Path- build_ext --inplace

The numbers indicate the increasing levels of Cythonization
Level 1 involved defining all variable as c variables
Level 2 involved defining the number of dimention of the c arrays and implimenting some key words that effect the compiling
Level 3 involved changing functions to be more c friendly
